## 0) 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
* The output of the program is the number, followed by:
  * if the number is greater than 0: `"is positive"`
  * if the number is 0: `"is zero"`
  * if the number is less than 0: `"is negative"`


## 1) 1-last_digit.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
* The output of the program is:
  * The string `"Last digit of"`, followed by `n`, followed by `"is"`, followed by:
    * if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `"and is greater than 5"`
    * if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `"and is 0"`
    * if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `"and is less than 6 and not 0"`


## 2) 2-print_alphabet.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.


## 3) 3-print_alphabets.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.


## 4) 4-print_alphabt.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase except `"q"` and `"e"`, followed by a new line.


## 5) 5-print_numbers.c
This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.


## 6) 6-print_numberz.c
This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* The variable of type `char` is not allowed


## 7) 7-print_tebahpla.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.


## 8) 8-print_base16.c
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.


## 9) 9-print_comb.c
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
* Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order
* The variable of type `char` is not allowed


## 10) 100-print_comb3.c
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
* The two digits must be different
* 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The variable of type `char` is not allowed


## 11) 101-print_comb4.c
This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
* Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
* The three digits must be different
* 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits


## 12) 102-print_comb5.c
This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
* The numbers should range from 0 to 99
* The two numbers should be separated by a space
* All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
* The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
